## Overview

This repository demonstrates **first-of-kind automated compliance** for the Plain Writing Act of 2010. We build an AI system that optimizes government documents for readability while preserving legal accuracy - solving the fundamental challenge that has prevented automation in federal agency compliance.

**Core Innovation**: Real-time knowledge distillation system that transforms dense regulatory language into plain English without breaking legal requirements.

## üéØ Problem & Solution

### The Government Compliance Gap (2024)
- **Federal agencies average B- grades** in Plain Writing Act compliance
- **Department of Labor manually trained 3,576 employees** at $200+ per person
- **No automated tools exist** for real-time compliance checking
- **$82B RegTech market** has no specialized government plain language solutions

### Our Technical Solution
**Knowledge Distillation for Government Compliance**: Teacher model (legal accuracy) ‚Üí Student model (plain language) with real-time optimization that maintains regulatory validity.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/michaeloboyle/legal-ai-demo.git
cd legal-ai-demo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start API server
python -m src.api.main

# API available at: http://localhost:8000
# Interactive docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Example API Usage
```bash
# Optimize government document for plain language
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/optimize-government-text" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "document": "The aforementioned regulatory provisions shall be implemented...",
    "target_grade_level": 10,
    "preserve_legal_accuracy": true
  }'

# Response includes optimized text, compliance scores, readability improvement
```

## üî¨ Research Foundation

Our approach builds on established research while creating novel applications:

- **Prior Art**: Leverages Katz-Bommarito legal complexity measurement and MIT plain language research
- **Innovation**: First automated Plain Writing Act compliance system with legal accuracy preservation
- **Market Gap**: No existing tools combine government compliance requirements with real-time AI optimization

See [research documentation](docs/research/) for comprehensive analysis of prior art and technical differentiation.

## üìà Business Impact

### Quantified Government Benefits
- **Department of Labor**: $715k annual training cost ‚Üí automated compliance
